It provides a convenient environment for developers to work collaboratively, share code snippets, and test their programs in real-time. 

These platforms typically support multiple programming languages, offer features like syntax highlighting, code autocompletion, and debugging tools.

For your founder, Shoaib Shaikh, with a passion for technology and a commitment to excellence, such a project aligns well with the software development landscape. 

Creating an efficient and user-friendly online code editor could contribute to the vision of redefining how developers collaborate and work on coding projects.
